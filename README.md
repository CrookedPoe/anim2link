# anim2link
This is an application written in Visual C# intended to convert .anim files exported by the OBJEX exporter to Link's animation format used by Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask.

Please note:
The automatic injector cannot overwrite an animation that is smaller than the one being converted. This is based on the detected size, and as such, if you overwrite an original animation with a smaller one, the new animation is now the size as the previous imported one.

Credits:
rankaisija ported/created the `Fortnite_Default_Dance` animation and I exported it from Blender. It's a great test case.
